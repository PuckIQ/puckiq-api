    <h3>About WoodMoney</h3>
    <div>
        The WoodMoney method of ranking NHL players into 3 tiers of Quality got its genesis in the comments section of the
        venerable Oilers blog lowetide.ca in 2015.
        Lowetide posters Woodguy and GMoney would pour through the shift data of games noting how coaches matched up players and
        how those matchups affect their results.  They were dissatisfied with the most common tools to determine Quality of
        Competition and decided to figure out a new method.
        It was decided that a database of results that could be broken down using Quality of Competition tiers was required and
        GMoney set off to create it. For the full story and methodology behind WoodMoney please read this:

        - When it comes to PuckIQ, Zsolt originally registered the puckiq.com domain back in 2011 with the aspiration
        of building a analytics website. Unfortunately life got in the way and PuckIQ had to be put on the back burner. After meeting GMoney & WG on Twitter back in 2016, and reading about WoodMoney over at WGâ€™s blog, Zsolt offered up the domain and his infrastructure/server operations experience to help make PuckIQ a reality. Zsolt currently manages the backend of PuckIQ including the data delivery mechanism as well as the overall server infrastructure.
